bag of words=0.7965
texture_repr_concat=0.9180
texture_repr_mean =0.3293

So, the texture_repr_mean has the smallest within-between ratio.

This is not as I expected. I expected bag of words maybe the one.

The reason I think is maybe most of the keypoint detected in bag of words are
meaningless because those are backgroud not the animal. Besides, maybe the means
is not so good to mark the animal. Therefore,bag of word failed on this.

On the contrary, the texture of those animals are quite different. So,their
response to different filter is also significant. That's why the texture work.
And for the texture_repr_concat, it maybe affected by the noisy background.

The best descriptor is the texture_repr_mean,because it has the best cluster 
result and easy to implement and also efficent to use.
